				"Born from an unknown family. He is unusually small and scrawny for a demon, chances of surviving as a kid were low. Seems like he doesn't know, or perhaps doesn't want to talk. Possibly has selective mutism. Lack of eyebrows and missing teeth (his canine seems to still be present, though visibly dull). His diet consists principally of meat and fish. Any other kind of food was observed to disrupt his digestive system. Nonetheless, his favorite food seems to be strawberries.",
				"Traces of his traumas as a teenager have carried on to his adult years. He doesn't express his needs, desires or opinions. He principally spends his time observing his surrounding, looking for facial cues. He appears to have no visible ambitions. By contrast, he appears to be adamant about acting according to his intuition. He hasn't been observed to laugh or smile very often. Has never been observed to be mad. ",
				"He seems to be living with a human nicknamed \"Butcher\", in his apartment. Their meeting is believed to have happened the day Stray fell unconscious in front of the human's house [exact day needed]. They seem to have not known each other before this incident. Past pictures suggest that Stray was undernourished and in a state of hypothermia at the time of his meeting with Butcher. No informations are currently available about their relationship. Another human he is in contact with is Galileo. He seems to be considering her like a close sibling and is the only known person he is affectionate with. No info is available explaining this behavior. These two humans are the only people he is in contact with.",

					"Stray was born in a family of 8 at the time. Though he wasn't the last child, he was the most vulnerable and weak of all the kids. He was abandoned by his family at the age of 3 and started living alone in the streets [to confirm] until the age of 10. Past sources described him as being a very curious and chatty kid, though he had trouble pronouncing words.",

					"From age 10 to 20, it appears that he spent his DBP with four other demons in an abandoned garage at an unknown location. Not much is known of what happened during those ten years but his physical and mental state quickly began deteriorating. Some exterior signs of mistreatment included: multiple infected injuries on body, burn marks on face (eyebrows most probably burned off), extremely skinny appearance and an apathetic behavior.",
					"Three of the four other demons who lived with him during the DBP seem to still be living together after Stray's departure. The fourth demon died one year after Stray left the shelter. Some infos are pointing towards death from mistreatment.",

				"present": [
					"It has been one year since Stray's departure from the shelter and his meeting with Butcher. Signs of PTSD have been observed. His physical condition has improved and the scars from his DBP are healing. Signs show that he still suffers from insomnia and paranoia: contact with humans other than Butcher and Galiléo is extremely hard and he tends to tense up when faced with new people or new situations.",
					"Current behavior described to be harmless. More informations needed.",

			"description": [
				"A human with muscular mass and height slightly above average. Naturally wavy dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Works as a freelancing butcher in his own shop. Income seems to be low. Does not have a partner nor children. Sources point towards a dislike of products made with milk [lactose intolerance was not found], but a liking to spicy dishes, which implies he simply does not have any good taste in food. Suffer from slight bad vision.",
				"He is often seen being friendly towards other people and has a tendency to help strangers: one instance of him saving a scared kitten from a tree was observed. This should be noted as ESB. He is registered as a member of the gym situated in the Corkscrew street and goes 4 times a week. Evidences show a vital need to take care for his appearence. Said appearance seems to add to the popularity to his shop [correlation study needed]. ",
				"The meeting with the demon \"Stray\" happened during the winter of year XXXX [exact day needed]. Butcher found the unconscious body of \"Stray\" in the snow in front of his shop. He carried him inside his apartment and called \"Galiléo\" to the rescue. They did not call the hospital [speculated reason: lack of funds] and gave him first aid. \"Galiléo\" was seen going back to work three hours later. It is not known when exactly \"Stray\" gained his consciousness back, but Butcher did not open his shop that day. Doesn't have contact with any other demon. Situation seems stable. ",

					"Born as the second child of an upper middle class family. He loved food and was slightly above the recommended weight for his age range. He was a pampered and loved by his bigger sister (three years older) and nanny as a child, though his parents did not give him as much attention. He had the habit of falling asleep whenever someone touched his hair.",
				],

				"teen": [
					"Attention from his nanny and sister faded as he became a teenager. It seems to correlate with the period when he started his rebellious phase. Rebellious phase started at age 15. First cigarette smoked at age 16. Sources show that his friends were what influenced his behavior and actions. Was seen shoplifting two times and cheating on his tests eleven times. His parents divorced at age 16 and he started living alone with his mom while his sister went abroad.",
					"It's apparent that his relationship with his mom stayed difficult thorough his teenager years. One of his diary page included the mention of a \"movie night\" ritual every week-end, where they would watch badly rated romance movies and cry. He seems to imply that those \"movie nights\" were the only time he felt close to his mom. ",

				"present": [
					"He changed drastically when he started his butchery studies (age 19). Changes includes: stopping smoking, building muscular mass, changing social circle and stopping any contact with his parents altogether. He met another human named \"Galiléo\" during this period and became close friend with her. He opened a butcher shop at age 21 in the Shovel Warehouse Street. Met the demon \"Stray\" six months later.",
					"He has developped signs of attachment towards \"Stray\" since their meeting, though the extends of those feelings have not been studied yet. ",
